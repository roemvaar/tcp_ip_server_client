# Client/Server Architecture

Basically, the client/server architecture is used when two (or more) computers need to share
information with one another. For example, the client requests information to the server, and
then the server provides this information back to the client, i.e., there's a back and forth
communication between the server and the client.

The server is simply a piece of software (program) that runs on an computer waiting for requests.

To make things even clearer, this software architecture is composed by at least to running programs,
first, the one running on the client computer and the on running on the server computer.

## Services

What is IP service port?

A port is a number used to uniquely identify a transaction over a network by specifying both the host,
and the service. They are necessary to differentiate between many different IP services, such as web
service (HTTP), mail service (SMTP), and file transfer (FTP).
